# An instance of the data that the code outputs

We are assuming a baseline observational time of 12 hrs = 43200 seconds.
And we are assuming that 100 stars can be simultaneously observed.
The numbers represent the number of seperate frames observed:
ex. temp_3.txt represents observations of 4 hrs, where we would have observed 300 stars
and these particular observations were generated for IMACS observations (which affects the velocity uncertainties).

I actually left the star lists untruncated in case we did not want to choose "300" random stars and instead choose on the basis of brightness or position.
